## ⚙️ How to Setup & Run Locally

1. **Clone the repository** (if hosted on GitHub):
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd muhib-portfolio
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the local development server**:

   npm run dev
   ```
   *The server will typically start at `http://localhost:5173/`.*

4. **Build for production** (when ready to deploy):
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

## 🎨 Customizing the Content

- **Personal Information**: Open the individual component files (like `About.jsx`, `Contact.jsx`, `Hero.jsx`) to update placeholder text with your actual bio, phone number, location, etc.
- **Changing Projects**: Navigate to `src/components/Projects.jsx` and look for the `projects` array at the top of the file to replace placeholder titles, descriptions, and Github links with your own work.
- **CV Download**: Place your resume PDF in the `/public/` directory and name it `muhib-cv.pdf`.

## 🚢 Deployment

Since this project is built with Vite, it's incredibly easy to deploy to platforms like **Vercel** or **Netlify**. 
Simply link your GitHub repository to either platform, and the build settings will be automatically detected (`npm run build`, output directory: `dist/`).
